function [baseline_model, P] = StationModelProjections(station_number)

% StationModelProjections Analyze modeled future temperature projections at individual stations
%===================================================================

% USAGE:  [baseline_model, P] = StationModelProjections(station_number) 
%

% DESCRIPTION:
%   This function calculate the projected future rate of temperature change at each of the stations.  
%
% INPUT:
%    staton_number: Number of the station from which to analyze historical temperature data
%    **Describe any other inputs you choose to include**
%
% OUTPUT:
%    baseline_model: [mean annual temperature over baseline period
%       (2006-2025); standard deviation of temperature over baseline period]
%    P: slope and intercept for a linear fit to annual mean temperature
%       values over the full 21st century modeled period
%   **list any other outputs you choose to include**

%% Read and extract the data from your station from the csv file
filename = ['model' num2str(station_number) '.csv'];
stationdata = readtable(filename); 
%Extract the year and annual mean temperature data
tempData = table2array(stationdata(:,4:15));
tempMean = nanmean(tempData);
tempStd = nanstd(tempData);
tempMin = min(tempData);
tempMax = max(tempData);

for i=1:12
    indnan = find (isnan(tempData(:,i)) -- 1);
    tempData(indnan,i)=tempMean(i);
end
tempAnnMean= mean(tempData')

%% Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the annual mean temperatures
%  over the baseline period over the first 20 years of the modeled 21st
%  century (2006-2025) - if you follow the template for output values I
%  provided above, you will want to combine these together into an array
%  with both values called baseline_model
 %<-- (this will take multiple lines of code - see the procedure you
 %followed in Part 1 for a reminder of how you can do this)
ind_baseline= find(stationdata.Year <== 2025 & stationdata.Year >=

%% Calculate the 5-year moving mean smoothed annual mean temperature anomaly over the modeled period
% Note that you could choose to provide these as an output if you want to
% have these values available to plot.
 %<-- anomaly
 %<-- smoothed anomaly

%% Calculate the linear trend in temperature this station over the modeled 21st century period
